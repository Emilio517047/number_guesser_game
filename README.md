# number_guesser_game

This was a small challenge project on Codecademy's introduction to JavaScript. I had to write functions to allow a number guessing game to work.
The aim is to input a number and the computer inputs a number. Whoever's number is closest to the secret target number, wins the round.

This is a very basic form of the game to get used to JavaScript.
